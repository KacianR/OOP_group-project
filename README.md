Software Solutions Now (SSN) is a software development company specializing in developing new programs and customising off-the-shelf applications. SSN was started as a small freelancing venture by two friends, the small venture has grown into a thriving business with over one hundred employees. Over the years, the company has maintained a simple payroll system in a spreadsheet application, which was sufficient based on the number of employees. Now that the business has grown, the system is no longer suitable, and as such the manager of the Accounts department has requested that a new system be developed. The manager provided the following information to the Software Engineering Department, to aid in developing the SSN Payroll Management System (PMS).
